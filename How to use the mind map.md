- At the start of the preparation, read the map to better understand what topics might be asked. Focus only on points and sections in bold font, which are the required topics.
- Grade yourself in each area to identify the weak spots, like this: "Mobile Domain: 4/5, API Design: 2/5". This will help you prioritize what to study.
- Focus on learning how to use the items in bold in the context of mobile system design.
- Practice solving mobile system design problems yourself.
- Review the "Interview Strategy (Non Tech)" section to better understand the format, expectations, and communication patterns to use.
